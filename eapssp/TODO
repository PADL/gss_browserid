Phase 1
=======

1. 32-bit WOW / build
2. Installer

Phase 2
=======

3. KSP for CIFS support
4. Port to Vista (likely qualification only)
5. Port to XP (this is probably not going to be possible because
   XP will only reliably negotiate between NTLM and Kerberos, does
   not support the parameterized EAP PRF in SChannel, etc)

Phase 3
=======

6. libradsec use SChannel instead of OpenSSL
7. Credential provider for Moonshot identity card support
8. Windows 8 claims support

- is there a bug with how we are using snprintf() and %S?
- in memory credentials architecture review
- generic credentials support (CredMan)
- discuss EAP-TLS SChannel impersonation bug with MS
- add thread user after reversion
- DLL manifests
- GSS_C_IDENTIFY_FLAG testing
- do we want to preserve attribute type information for claims
- dates in INF build
- allocate claims contiguously
- msetup tool
